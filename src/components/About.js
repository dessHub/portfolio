        <div className="about__copy">
            <p>I'm a self-motivated full-stack web developer with 5+ years of experience. I am passionate about building products that make our users’ lives better by leveraging data from user’s interaction with the product. I find joy solving common problems with technology and always looking forward to the next challenge. It's important to me that I add value to the teams I work with. I strive not to be successful, but to be of value.
Currently, I work as a Front-End Software Engineer at Andela and Lola – leveraging on both teams collaboration. From this partnership, I continue to learn more efficacious software engineering practices and how to effectively manage product teams.
When I'm not coding I enjoy comedy series or hiking with my friends.
